# CatChow – ITSSDLC Security & Access Control Enhancement
### ITSSDLC – S17 – MCO
<hr/>

This project is an enhanced iteration of **CatChow**, originally developed for the **MOBDEVE**
course. The system was extended for ITSSDLC with additional security, access control,
and auditing features.

## ITSSDLC Enhancements

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Implemented MFA using email-based authentication links.
   - Optional support for authenticator applications.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Introduced users, groups, roles, and rights in the database schema.
   - Enforced authorization checks across system features.

3. **Audit Trails and Logging**
   - Added audit logs for all critical system actions.
   - Logs include user identity, action type, and timestamps.
   - Sensitive or unnecessary data are excluded from logs.
